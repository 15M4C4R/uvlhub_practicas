# Getting Started

This guide covers the basics of cloning the UVLHub.io repository and setting up your environment.

## Clone the Repository

To clone the UVLHub.io repository, run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/diverso-lab/uvlhub.git
```

## Preparing Your Environment

### Create an .env File

Copy the example environment file to get started:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

### Zenodo Token

To use Zenodo integration, obtain a token from Zenodo. We recommend using the Sandbox version for testing:

```
cp app/blueprints/zenodo/.env.example app/blueprints/zenodo/.env
```
